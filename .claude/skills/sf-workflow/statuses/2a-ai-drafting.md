# STATUS (drafting lifecycle): AI Drafting

AI produces the first draft of the SRS page in the configured backend (Notion, Confluence, local markdown, …).

## Action checklist

- [ ] **Run the drafter:** `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh transition-drafting <ticket> ai-draft`
  - dispatches to `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh draft --ticket <ticket>`
  - reads `tools.srs.backend`, resolves the `SrsAdapter`, writes via `createEpicPage` / `createFrPage`
- [ ] **Post the page URL** as a ticket comment so the reviewer can jump without leaving the board
- [ ] **Leave the board** — column stays `In progress` until the lifecycle closes with `transition-drafting done`

## Errors to avoid

- Hand-drafting the spec (always go through the skill CLI — the backend adapter is the single integration point)
- Moving the ticket to `AI testing` — code-path statuses are blocked by the SRS guard
- Bypassing `srs-cli.sh draft` with direct backend SDK calls
- Deleting the `srs:*` label before `spawning` succeeds — the label keeps the ticket in the drafting lifecycle
