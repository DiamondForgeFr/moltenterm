Actions:
  help                              Print this message
  validate [manifest]               Smoke-test the configured backend via adapter.init()
  browse --parent <id> [--manifest] List direct children of a parent page (JSON)
  draft --from notion-pages --ids <id1,id2,...> [--manifest]
                                    Fetch pages from the backend as RawContent (JSON).
                                    The skill then drafts Epic/FR specs conversationally
                                    and hands them back via `write`.
  draft --from codebase [--path <dir>] [--manifest]
                                    Scan the local codebase and emit structured
                                    findings (JSON). The skill then drafts Epic/FR
                                    specs conversationally from the findings and
                                    hands them back via `write`. Scanners plug in
                                    via sibling SUBs under #173 (13.2 + 13.3).
  write  --spec <path> [--manifest] [--no-clear-pending]
                                    Apply a DraftCandidate[] spec file : creates Epic /
                                    FR pages through the adapter and clears the
                                    `tools.srs.pendingIngestion` flag on success.
  spawn  --epic <page-url-or-id> [--ticket <n>] [--version <title-url-or-id>] [--milestone <name>] [--reconciliation-plan <path>] [--dry-run] [--manifest] [--bypass-reason <text>]
  normalize [--feature <url-or-id>] [--version-name <name>] [--apply] [--manifest] [--root-page <id>]
                                    Give an unversioned feature a version page and
                                    MOVE its FR pages under it (ids and URLs survive).
                                    Dry-run by default; --apply is required to write.
                                    Enumerate FR page children of a drafted Epic and
                                    create a Story sub-ticket per FR under the parent
                                    ticket. Each child is created as a GitHub
                                    sub-issue tagged `srs:new`; board placement
                                    follows the project's default automation.
                                    `--reconciliation-plan` verifies board, SRS,
                                    and implementation evidence before mutation,
                                    then reuses exact canonical FR tickets.
                                    `--dry-run` previews without writing.
  apply-update [--patch <path>] [--manifest]
                                    Apply a conversational eval-hook patch
                                    (ADD-only : new UR / new FR / new DS / new TC)
                                    to the configured backend. Reads patch JSON
                                    from stdin when --patch is omitted. Used by
                                    the `sf-srs` eval hook after user accepts
                                    the proposed diff — see SKILL.md.
  eval  [--path <dir>] [--root-page <id>] [--threshold <pct>] [--json] [--manifest]
                                    Score SRS freshness vs. codebase (batch).
                                    Lists FR pages under the configured root,
                                    runs the scanners, and reports drift
                                    findings (FR pages with no matching code,
                                    code areas with no FR, untested FRs).
                                    Exit 0 when overall score >= threshold,
                                    1 otherwise. --json emits the structured
                                    report for CI consumption.

Common options :
  --manifest <path>                 Manifest file to read (default: .saasfoundry.json)

Exit codes (shared contract) :
  0 success · 2 bad input · 3 missing backend · 4 unknown backend · 5 runtime ·
  6 write partial (rollbackHint) · 7 write ok but pendingIngestion clear failed

Dispatch reads `tools.srs.backend` from `.saasfoundry.json` and routes through
the matching SrsAdapter. See .claude/skills/sf-srs/SKILL.md for the contract.
