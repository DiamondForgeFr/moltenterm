## Execution capabilities

Use the current agent's native tools for reading, editing, shell commands and delegation.
When delegation is available and authorized, assign independent work to agents; otherwise
execute the same steps sequentially. A sequential self-review is not an independent review:
report that limitation and retain any required human review. Tool names in legacy examples
describe capabilities, not required APIs. Use the user's current request as skill arguments.
Do not assume Claude Code hooks, model selection, tool permissions or credentials transfer.
Run preconditions explicitly, and stop to report a missing capability when no equivalent exists.
Never bypass CLI guards, required approvals, tests or workflow status exit conditions.
The project manifest and workflow rules take precedence over generic skill examples,
including branch names, commit formats, staging, pushing and approval requirements.
Legacy /task examples name roles: use native delegation if available and authorized,
or perform the role's work sequentially with the review limitation stated above.

## Parallel implementation and Git worktrees

Propose parallel worktrees only when the user's request contains independent writing streams
that can be delivered concurrently. Read-only exploration and review may use parallel agents
without separate worktrees. Work with sequential dependencies, overlapping file ownership or
unclear boundaries must use one feature worktree and sequential execution.

Before proposing parallel implementation, read `.saasfoundry.json` and use
`workflow.workingBranch`; never hardcode a branch name. Keep the primary checkout on that
configured working branch. Do not let feature workers write in the primary checkout while
parallel worktrees are active.

For each independent writing stream, define one ticket, branch and worktree path, plus its owned
files and dependency boundary. Start from a synchronized configured working branch. Each worker
must stay inside its assigned worktree and ownership boundary, preserve other agents' changes
and never revert unrelated work. The agent proposes this execution shape; the user retains
control when parallel implementation was not already authorized. If authorization, clean
separation, Git support or a synchronized base is unavailable, explain the constraint and use
one worktree or sequential execution.

After each stream is complete, commit and push through the configured workflow. After its merge,
return to the primary checkout, check out and synchronize the configured working branch, verify
the merge, then remove the completed worktree and local branch only when they are merged and no
longer in use. Never remove or overwrite user-owned worktrees, branches, uncommitted changes,
stashes or credentials implicitly.


# Workflow SaaSFoundry Solo

Complexity-adaptive development workflow with GitHub Projects (GitHub Projects, Jira, Notion, Linear, etc.)

## Auto-trigger keywords
workflow status, check workflow, what should i do, next step, workflow help, current status, complexity, detect complexity

## 🎯 Complexity-Based Adaptive Workflow

This workflow adapts its rigor based on ticket complexity:

| Level | Label | Process | Use Case |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| **bug** | 🐛 Bug Fix | Direct fix, regression test | Quick bug fixes |
| **low** | 🟢 Low | Oneshot-style (minimal ceremony) | Simple tasks |
| **medium** | 🟡 Medium | Structured analysis and planning | Standard features |
| **complex** | 🔴 Complex | Deep analysis + adversarial review | Critical features |

**Key principle:** Higher complexity = more rigor (analysis depth, planning detail, adversarial review, test coverage)

## 🎚️ Nature axis (user-facing / internal / bundled-pr)

Orthogonal to complexity. Controls whether **Human Testing** and **In Review** are mandatory or optional in the lifecycle.

| Label | Use case | Workflow effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nature:user-facing` | Bug fix or feature with visible UX impact — anything a user can click, see, or feel | Mandatory `AI Testing → Human Testing → In Review → Done` |
| `nature:internal` | Refactor, scaffolding, internal tooling, doc-only change — ships its own PR | Optional `AI Testing → In Review → Done` (skip Human Testing) |
| `nature:bundled-pr` | Child ticket under a delivery parent whose one atomic commit lands on the **parent's branch** — there is no individual child PR | `AI Testing → Done` (skip Human Testing **and** In Review — PR is at the delivery parent) |

**Default** — if a ticket has no `nature:*` label, the workflow treats it as `user-facing` (safe default).

**Why this exists** — Human Testing is theatrical on tickets with no user-visible surface (the existing tests + lint + typecheck already cover the integration risk). And `In Review` on a bundled child is a board lie: there is no PR to review at child level — the delivery parent's PR carries the merge ceremony. Bundled children go AI Testing → Done directly.

**Delivery-parent Human Testing** — when a delivery parent contains `nature:bundled-pr` children, the meaningful manual validation happens on the delivery parent's PR after all children are validated. An Epic only groups delivery parents and never owns this PR.

**Guards** (all enforced by `update-status`):

- **Nature guard** on `→ In Review` from `AI Testing` — requires `nature:internal`. `nature:bundled-pr` is rejected here (must go to `Done` instead). Default (no label / `user-facing`) must go through Human Testing first. Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_NATURE_GUARD=1`.
- **PR-state guard** — `→ Human Testing` requires an open draft PR; `→ In Review` requires an open non-draft PR. Unknown PR state blocks these transitions. Epic groupers without a PR keep their derived lifecycle. Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_PR_EXISTENCE_GUARD=1`.
- **Nature guard** on `→ Done` from `AI Testing` — allowed **only** for `nature:bundled-pr` (everyone else must go through `In Review` first). Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_NATURE_GUARD=1`.
- **PR-merged guard** on `→ Done` — normal delivery tickets require a matching PR verified merged into the working branch. Aggregate Epics and verified `nature:bundled-pr` children are exempt because they own no PR. Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_PR_MERGED_GUARD=1`.

## 🧩 Ticket Hierarchy (Epic / Delivery parent / Child ticket)

SaaSFoundry Solo distinguishes an optional grouping Epic from a delivery parent. Every child created by
`create-subtask` is a **native GitHub Projects sub-issue**. A child is either a normal child with its own branch and PR,
or a bundled child whose single atomic commit lands on its delivery parent's branch.

```
(Epic)                 optional grouper — no branch or PR
 └─ Story|Task|Issue   delivery parent — owns a branch and PR
     └─ Child ticket   native sub-issue: own branch/PR, or bundled commit on parent branch
```

| Level | Role | Deliverable | Tracking artifact | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Epic** | Optional grouper for related delivery parents (SRS feature, bug batch, transverse refactor) | **None directly** — no branch, no commit, no PR | Ticket with native issue type `sf-epic` and delivery-parent tickets linked as sub-issues | **Derived from children** (see rule below) |
| **Story** | Delivers user-observable value | Branch + commits + PR | Regular ticket, `story.tpl.ts` body — Acceptance Criteria section | Explicit, full workflow lifecycle |
| **Task** | Delivers a technical action | Branch + commits + PR | Regular ticket, `task.tpl.ts` body — Completion Criteria section | Explicit, full workflow lifecycle |
| **Issue (bug)** | Task variant for defects | Branch + commits + PR | Regular ticket, `issue.tpl.ts` body — Behavior/Expected/Repro/Environment/Impact/Evidence | Explicit, full workflow lifecycle |
| **Child ticket** | Deliverable under a delivery parent | Normal child: branch + PR. Bundled child: one atomic commit on the parent's branch | Native GitHub Projects sub-issue created by `create-subtask` | Normal child follows the full lifecycle; `nature:bundled-pr` may go AI Testing → Done |

**Child execution modes** — use a normal child when the work needs independent review, a branch, or a PR. Use
`nature:bundled-pr` only for one atomic, tightly coupled commit on the delivery parent's branch; it has no child PR
and may move from AI Testing directly to Done after validation. “Subtask” is shorthand for this native child ticket,
not a commit-only concept.

An Epic remains an aggregate grouping ticket spanning one or more milestones. Its status is derived: the first child
entering `In progress` brings the Epic to `In progress`, and the last child reaching `Done` brings the Epic to `Done`.
It does not become a delivery parent or open a bundled PR. If several child
deliverables must ship in one PR, make their immediate parent a Story, Task, or Issue with its own branch and PR;
the Epic only groups that delivery parent.

### Epic status roll-up

An Epic is an aggregate with two derived transitions:

| Child event | Epic transition |
| --- | --- |
| The first native child enters `In progress` | `Backlog → Ready → In progress`, or `Ready → In progress` |
| The last incomplete native child enters `Done` | `In progress → Done` |

The Epic stays `In progress` while its children pass through testing and review. It never owns a branch or PR and may
span multiple milestones; its delivery children carry their own milestone assignments. The parent Done guard checks
every native child's project-board Status. Backlog, Ready, In progress, AI Testing, Human Testing, In Review, or an
unknown status blocks Done. Incomplete children do not block the parent's testing or review phases.

## How to use this skill

**FIRST TIME on a ticket:**
1. **Detect complexity:** `/workflow detect-complexity <ticket-number>`
2. **Confirm with developer:** AI suggests, developer decides
3. **Follow adaptive process:** Each status adapts to complexity level

**BEFORE EVERY ACTION:**
1. Invoke this skill with `/workflow status <ticket-number>`
2. Read the COMPLETE description of the current status
3. Follow EXACTLY the instructions from that description
4. Never guess - if uncertain, run `/workflow status` again

## Configuration (Source of Truth)

All workflow configuration lives in **`.saasfoundry.json`** at the project root. See [manifest schema](../../../.claude/docs/manifest-schema.md) for the full field list and read snippets. **Never hardcode branch names** — always read from the manifest.

## Output language

Ticket titles, bodies, comments, commit messages and code comments follow **`language.tickets` / `language.codeComments`** in `.saasfoundry.json`, which default to English.

```bash
jq -r '.language.tickets      // "en"' .saasfoundry.json
jq -r '.language.codeComments // "en"' .saasfoundry.json
```

**The language of the conversation is not the signal.** A session held in French still produces English tickets and English commit messages when the project says `en`. Only change language when the
manifest says so.

## Available Commands

### Workflow Status Commands

**`/workflow status <ticket>`**
Displays the current status of the ticket and loads the complete description of that status.

**`/workflow next <ticket>`**
Indicates the next status and what needs to be done to get there.

**`/workflow validate <ticket>`**
Checks if all conditions are met to move to the next status.

**`/workflow help`**
Displays the list of statuses and their role.

### Complexity Commands (NEW)

**`/workflow detect-complexity <ticket>`**
Auto-suggests complexity level based on:
- Number of files potentially impacted
- Keywords (auth, payment, security → complex)
- Risk assessment
- Historical patterns

Developer always has final say.

**`/workflow retag <ticket> <new-complexity>`**
Changes ticket complexity level (bug | low | medium | complex).
Adjusts remaining workflow steps to match new complexity.

**Guard** — `update-status <ticket> <target>` is rejected for any target other than `Backlog` if the ticket has no `complexity: *` label. `detect-complexity` only suggests — you must call `retag` to persist. The guard fails open if label fetch errors (offline / auth issues). Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_COMPLEXITY_GUARD=1` (rare).

### Workflow Phase Commands (Complexity-Adaptive)

**`/workflow prepare <ticket> <complexity>`** — adaptive analyze + plan phase (Backlog → Ready).
**`/workflow test <ticket> [complexity]`** — validation + optional adversarial review (→ AI Testing).

| Complexity | `prepare` behavior | `test` behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **bug** | Skip — direct to implementation | Validation only (build, lint, typecheck, unit tests) |
| **low** | Minimal — 2–3 files, mental plan | Validation only |
| **medium** | Standard — 2–4 agents, detailed plan + approval | Validation only |
| **complex** | Deep — 6–10 agents, comprehensive plan + approval | Validation **+ adversarial review** (security, logic, performance) |

## Tool-Specific Commands

Workflow commands that interact with your project management tool (GitHub Projects, Jira, Notion, Linear) are delegated to tool-specific CLIs.

The workflow skill automatically routes commands to the appropriate tool based on your `.saasfoundry.json` configuration.

**Example:** Creating a subtask
```bash
# This command is automatically routed to the correct tool
.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh create-subtask <parent> <title>
```

See your tool-specific skill documentation for complete command reference:
- GitHub Projects: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-github-projects/SKILL.md`
- Jira: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-jira/SKILL.md`
- Notion: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-notion/SKILL.md`
- Linear: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-linear/SKILL.md`

## SRS Handoff (drafting / spawning tickets)

When a ticket crosses into **Ready** and requires Software Requirements Specifications (US / UR / FR / DS / TC),
stop and hand off to the agnostic SRS skill:

- `.claude/skills/sf-srs/SKILL.md` — selects the configured SRS backend from `.saasfoundry.json → tools.srs.backend`
- `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh validate` — smoke-tests the backend adapter (init OK, exit 0)
- `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh draft|spawn|eval` — backend-neutral actions (sibling SUBs under #174 fill the body)

Never bypass the skill to write SRS by hand — the backend dispatch is how new projects get to swap Notion for
Confluence / local markdown without touching the workflow logic.

### Drafting lifecycle (tickets labelled `srs:drafting | srs:update | srs:new`)

SRS tickets don't flow through the code-path statuses — they have their own lifecycle inside the `In progress` board column:

```
Ready → In progress (brainstorm)
         → ai-draft        (srs-cli.sh draft)
         → human-review    (owner reviews the backend page)
         → spawning        (srs-cli.sh spawn — creates Backlog children)
         → done            (board status → Done)
```

Drive it with:

```bash
.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh transition-drafting <ticket> <phase> [phase options]
# phase: ai-draft | human-review | spawning | done

# spawning requires an explicit SRS target and verified reconciliation plan
.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh transition-drafting <ticket> spawning \
  --epic <feature-url-or-id> [--version <title-url-or-id>] [--milestone <name>] \
  --reconciliation-plan <path> [--dry-run]
```

Each phase is documented in detail:
- `statuses/3a-ai-drafting.md` — AI drafter runs against the configured backend
- `statuses/3b-human-review.md` — spec owner reviews and approves
- `statuses/3c-spawning.md` — children land in Backlog, drafting ticket reaches Done

**Guard** — `update-status <ticket> <any testing/review status>` is rejected when the ticket carries an `srs:*` label. Use `transition-drafting` instead. The guard fails open if label fetch errors (offline / auth issues) so normal teams are not punished by infrastructure hiccups.

### Rule 8 — spawning Stories from SRS

Once an Epic page tree is drafted (Main spec + FR-001…FR-N children), the Story sub-tickets under the parent must be created by the spawner, not by hand:

```bash
.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh transition-drafting <parent> spawning \
  --epic <page-url-or-id> [--version <title-url-or-id>] [--milestone <name>] \
  --reconciliation-plan <path> [--dry-run]
```

The reconciliation plan must exactly cover the selected version and cite verified board, SRS, and implementation evidence. The spawner skips delivered/superseded FRs, reuses the single ticket whose canonical page matches, creates only missing/partial work, and blocks before mutation on unavailable or ambiguous evidence. Preview with `--dry-run`, then rerun the same command without it.

On SRS-enabled projects (`tools.srs.backend` is set), `create-subtask` refuses calls without `--bypass-srs <reason>` and exits 2. The escape hatch is legitimate only for:

- Meta tickets that don't map to an FR page (SRS tooling, drafter refactors, eval polish)
- Bootstrapping an Epic's own SUBs during rollout before the page tree exists

Typing the reason is the audit trail — pick something a reviewer can grep for (`spawned-from-srs`, `meta-srs-tooling`, `bootstrap-epic-174`…). If the ticket represents a feature requirement, the answer is always "go draft it first, then spawn."

### Conversational eval hook (SRS-enabled projects)

When `tools.srs.enabled = true`, Claude must interject during conversation turns whose content looks like a new User Requirement / Functional Requirement / Design decision / Test Case, propose a diff, and on user accept apply it via `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh apply-update`. The detection heuristics, confirmation flow, and scope limits (ADD-only in v1) live in the sf-srs SKILL.md — see its `## Conversational eval hook (SUB-10)` section. This skill only references it ; never duplicate the heuristics here.

## Draft PR lifecycle

After AI validation (including the configured heavy local suite), use `workflow-cli.sh create-pr <ticket> --draft` before Human Testing. Keep the test plan and results on that PR. After developer approval and required non-regression tests, push then use `workflow-cli.sh ready-pr <ticket>` before In Review. Creation retries reuse the existing PR without changing its draft state. Use `draft-pr <ticket>` explicitly when returning a ready PR to human retesting. Internal/solo routes may create a ready PR directly.

With the updated CI policy, draft PRs skip test/build CI. When adopting these skills in an existing project, inspect its checked-in workflows and hooks: refreshing instructions alone does not update external CI configuration or remove custom push hooks. Readiness and subsequent ready-PR pushes run full CI; returning to draft cancels obsolete runs. Quick commit checks remain enabled; heavy local validation belongs to AI Testing instead of every push.


### GitHub Ready for review button

For GitHub Projects, `.github/workflows/pr-review-sync.yml` listens to `ready_for_review` and calls `workflow-cli.sh sync-pr-review <PR>`. The button is the developer's approval to enter review; the job still enforces the workflow guards. The PR must close the ticket named by its configured feature/fix branch convention. Same-repository PRs are supported; fork PRs require the normal manual CLI transition.

Configure the Actions secret `SF_PROJECTS_TOKEN` with access to the repository and write access to the configured organization Project (a dedicated token with `repo` and `project` scopes, or an equivalent appropriately scoped credential). The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot access Projects. Never put credentials in the manifest or PR.

The listener executes only trusted default-branch code, never PR code. Commit it to the default branch before expecting automatic updates; it cannot retroactively process clicks made before installation. A failed run caused by missing credentials can be rerun after configuration. Already-in-review tickets are unchanged, and stale events cannot advance a reverted PR. Missing linkage or invalid workflow state produces an actionable failure instead of bypassing guards.

`installWorkflowSkill` deposits the listener for GitHub Projects while preserving an existing file with the same name. When adopting it into an existing project, compare the checked-in listener with `scaffolds/skills-templates/workflow/github/pr-review-sync.yml` in the CLI package; skill refresh alone does not replace customized Actions files.

## Workflow Statuses

1. **Backlog** (GRAY) — Read `statuses/1-backlog.md` for full description
2. **In Progress** (BLUE) — Read `statuses/2-in-progress.md` for full description
3. **AI Testing** (PURPLE) — Read `statuses/3-ai-testing.md` for full description
4. **In Review** (PINK) — Read `statuses/4-in-review.md` for full description
5. **Done** (GREEN) — Read `statuses/5-done.md` for full description

**⚠️ This skill is your SOURCE OF TRUTH for the workflow.**

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS read the status description** before taking any action
2. **NEVER skip steps** described in a status
3. **NEVER move to the next status** without meeting all exit conditions
4. **ASK if uncertain** - don't assume or guess
5. **CLOSE CHILD TICKETS AS THEY LAND** — every child is a native GitHub Projects sub-issue. A normal child reaches `Done` only after its own PR is verified merged; a bundled child reaches `Done` after its atomic commit is validated on the delivery parent's branch. Close each child immediately and verify `gh issue view <child> --json state` prints `CLOSED` before starting the next sibling. Never batch closures.
6. **PARENT DONE IS GATED BY CHILDREN** — a delivery parent or Epic cannot enter `Done` until every native child ticket's project-board Status is exactly `Done`. Run `github-projects-cli.sh list-incomplete-children <N>`; any returned or unverifiable child blocks the transition. An Epic moves to In progress with its first active child and to Done with its last completed child.
7. **FINISH THE CURRENT TICKET BEFORE STARTING ANOTHER** — if a ticket sits in any status between `In Progress` and `Done` (see the Workflow Statuses section above), drive it to `Done` before claiming or starting another. The only override is an explicit developer request to pause.
8. **TICKETS FROM SRS** — when `tools.srs.backend` is set in `.saasfoundry.json`, Story sub-tickets under an SRS Epic must be spawned from the canonical FR pages, not hand-written. Use the evidence-first `transition-drafting <parent> spawning --epic <feature> [--version <version>] [--milestone <release>] --reconciliation-plan <path>` flow. It renders each body from `renderStoryTicketBody` and reconciles exact canonical tickets before mutation. The `create-subtask` command rejects any call without `--bypass-srs <reason>` on SRS-enabled projects — see the "SRS Handoff" section above. The escape hatch exists for meta tickets (SRS refactors, tooling) but must never be used to duplicate an FR that already has a page.

9. **ANNOUNCE + STREAM LONG COMMANDS** — before any command expected to take more than ~5 seconds (test suites, builds, commit/push hooks, Docker scenarios), announce in one sentence what runs and the expected duration. Over ~60 seconds, run it in the background and stream its progress markers to the user as they appear (e.g. `tail -f <log> | grep -E --line-buffered "PASS|FAIL|\[sf-progress\]"`) — never block silently. Report the outcome with numbers, and relay the ▶ AI / ⏳ Dev banner printed by `update-status` after every transition.

## Implementation

The status descriptions are in the `statuses/` directory:
- Each status has its own markdown file
- Descriptions include: when to enter, mandatory actions, exit conditions, next status
- The CLI script (`workflow-cli.sh`) queries the project management tool and displays the appropriate description

## Where this sits in the zero-to-project flow

This skill carries **phases 5 to 7 — *create the tickets*, *base setup*, then *features*** of the flow a user walks when they arrive with a POC and no project. The map — every phase, its entry, its checkable exit, and how to resume mid-way — lives in the
`tool-saasfoundry` skill under "The zero-to-project flow".

It starts from an SRS carrying FRs and a configured board, and the first ticket moving past Backlog is what marks the base setup underway.

On a resumed session, run `tool-saasfoundry`'s `scripts/recap.sh` before assuming anything: it reads the phase from the manifest and the board, never from chat history.

### Milestones

A release scope is defined in this layer and projected per tool — `workflow-cli.sh milestone create|list|show|scope|assign|associate`. GitHub has native milestones, Jira fix versions, Linear cycles; the concept does not belong to any of them.

A version is **associated** to a release, never equal to it: one milestone per release, and several SRS version pages may point at it. The association travels with the milestone in the tool that holds it, not in `.saasfoundry.json`.

**A milestone reports; it never blocks a release.** It states where the scope stands and asks for an acknowledgement to continue on an incomplete one — it does not refuse. See Epic #542.

The `tool-saasfoundry` skill carries the Milestone Guardrail: when to raise the subject, and how to propose a scope from evidence rather than from a guess.
